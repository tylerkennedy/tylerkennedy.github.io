If your iPhone is being bombarded with spam text messages you need a way to block them.\niPhones offer a few options for stopping spam texts. Apple provides documentation on blocking spam text messages with iOS.\nIf you want to save a little time reading, here is a quick summary of the steps you can take to remove unwanted texts from your iPhone:\nBlock the Spam Text Sender The easiest way to stop spam texts is to block the sender. There are three steps to do this:\n  In the Messages app, open the message from the sender you want to block. Tap the sender at the top, then tap ‚Äòinfo‚Äô ‚ÑπÔ∏è.\n  This will open a new page, press ‚Äòinfo‚Äô again on the right.\n  Scroll down and click ‚ÄòBlock this Caller‚Äô.\n  This method works great if you get spam texts from the same sender. However, if you are being annoyed by messages from new senders daily, this method is ineffective. Blocking texts this way requires you to block every phone number that texts you.\nReport Junk Messages Next, Apple provides iPhone users the option to report junk. This will delete the message from your phone and report the sender and message contents to Apple.\nTo report a message as junk, open the message from a sender not saved in your contents, below the message tap ‚ÄòReport Junk‚Äô.\nFilter Unknown Senders By enabling this setting you will no longer receive notifications when you get a text from a sender not saved to your contacts. This provides more protection from spam by different senders. Here are the steps:\n Go to settings on your iPhone Scroll down and tap on ‚ÄòMessages‚Äô Scroll down and tap on ‚ÄòUnknown \u0026 Spam‚Äô Enable ‚ÄòFilter Unknown Senders‚Äô  The downside of this setting is that if you receive any texts from a sender not in your contacts you will not get the notification. The message will still appear in your messages app but it will be under the Junk tab.\nThis can cause you to miss text messages accidentally if the sender is not saved in your contacts.\nApps Can Make Blocking Spam Texts Even Easier Apple‚Äôs built-in features are a good start to blocking spam texts. However, if you want greater customization over how you filter spam you should consider using an app.\nDont Text makes it easy to customize how you block spam. Create custom rules to choose which messages make it into your inbox. With Dont Text, you can set keywords to block spam by the contents of the message. Also, add keywords so important texts never go to the Junk folder.\nThe advanced features of Dont Text keep your iPhone spam free, here‚Äôs how you can get started:\nInstall Dont Text Dont Text makes it simple to block spam texts messages on your iPhone. To get started, download Dont Text from the App Store for free.\nAfter downloading the app, follow the instructions on the screen to enable the app in your settings.

This tab is where you can add custom keywords in the app. Keywords give you the power to choose how to block spam texts.\nThere are two types of keywords you can add: block and allow.\nBlock When you receive a message from someone not saved in your contacts, Dont Text will block that message if it contains the keyword.\nBlocked messages are sent to the junk tab in the messages app.\nAllow You can also set keywords to allow messages through the filter. This prevents a message from being accidentally blocked by another keyword.\nHow to Add Keywords in the App To add a keyword in the app, tap ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô in the top right corner on the ‚ÄòBlock List‚Äô tab. You should then see this screen:\nChoose the type of keyword (block or allow) and enter the keyword. Once you‚Äôve done that press ‚ÄòAdd‚Äô and you‚Äôre all set.\nYou can keep adding as many keywords as you want.\nUpgrade to Worry Free Filtering (Optional) For more help blocking spam texts on your iPhone, upgrade to Worry Free Filtering.
